A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that makes decisions based on a series of conditions or rules. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and relationships, while decision trees are simpler and easier to interpret. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and data.

A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that makes decisions based on a series of conditions or rules. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and relationships, while decision trees are simpler and easier to interpret. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and data.

A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that makes decisions based on a series of conditions or rules. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and relationships, while decision trees are simpler and easier to interpret. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and data.

A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that makes decisions based on a series of conditions or rules. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and relationships, while decision trees are simpler and easier to interpret. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and data.

A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that makes decisions based on a series of conditions or rules. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and relationships, while decision trees are simpler and easier to interpret. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and data.

Doctors and healthcare staff deal with a ton of information every day, and this setup basically acts like a smart reference assistant that can pull accurate details straight from trusted sources like The Merck Manual in seconds. Instead of digging through thousands of pages, they get context-specific answers instantly — and that can make a real difference in critical situations.\n","\n","Another thing that stood out to me is how much prompt engineering and retriever tuning actually shape the quality of the output. A few adjustments to temperature, top-p, and chunk sizes completely changed how relevant and clear the answers were. That means if this were scaled into an actual product, fine-tuning would play a huge role in how reliable and “human” it feels.\n","\n","Performance-wise, I also found that you don’t need a massive setup to make this useful. Even running Mistral-7B in 4-bit mode on a T4 GPU, the model stayed responsive and consistent. That shows real potential for clinics, hospitals, or research teams that might not have huge compute resources.\n","\n","If I were to recommend next steps for the business, I’d focus on a few areas:\n","\n","Pilot it in a real clinical setting — start small with one department and see how it impacts decision speed and confidence.\n","\n","Expand the knowledge base — bring in more verified medical sources, drug databases, or even local policy documents to make it more versatile.\n","\n","Set up a validation process — have medical reviewers or specialists check the AI’s responses regularly to make sure the system stays accurate and compliant.\n","\n","Make it user-friendly — a simple chat or dashboard interface would make it easy for doctors or nurses to get quick answers without leaving their workflow.\n","\n","Keep iterating — as feedback comes in, retrain or fine-tune the retriever and prompts to make responses sharper and more
